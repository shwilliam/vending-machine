## Development

1. Install dependencies (`npm i`)
2. Watch `src/` and compile on change (`npm run build: watch`)
3. Locally serve the front end with `npm start`.

## Tests

To run the tests use the `test` npm script (`npm t`) or watch your files for changes by running `npm run test:watch`.

You can run the script `test:types` to run the TypeScript type checker against inferred JSDoc types.
